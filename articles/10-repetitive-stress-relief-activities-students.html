                    <p class="lead">Feeling stressed before an exam? Overwhelmed by deadlines?</p>
                    <p>For many high school and college students, <strong>stress and anxiety</strong> can feel like a daily battle. The good news is that simple repetitive actions â€” from doodling to <a href="../" title="Free bubble popping game for stress relief">popping bubbles</a> â€” can calm the mind, ease tension, and improve focus.</p>
                    <p>In this article, we'll explore <strong>10 repetitive stress relief activities</strong> backed by psychology and student experiences. Each activity is quick, simple, and perfect for relieving stress between classes, during study sessions, or before a big test.</p>

                <section class="article-section">
                    <h2>Why Repetitive Actions Reduce Stress in Students</h2>
                    <p>When your brain feels overwhelmed, <strong>repetitive actions</strong> can create a soothing rhythm that helps you reset. These actions act like mental "anchors," redirecting your attention away from anxious thoughts and into something predictable.</p>

                    <p>Research suggests that repetitive movements:</p>
                    <ul class="stress-benefits-list">
                        <li><strong>Soothe the nervous system</strong> by lowering cortisol (the stress hormone).</li>
                        <li><strong>Encourage mindfulness</strong> by keeping attention focused on the present.</li>
                        <li><strong>Provide comfort</strong> through familiar, repetitive patterns.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>For students, this means you don't need hours of meditation to find calm â€” just a few minutes of <strong>repetitive activity</strong> can make a difference.</p>
