                    <h2>The Student Anxiety Problem</h2>
                    <p>Between exams, assignments, social pressure, and the uncertainty of the future, <strong>high school and college students</strong> face record-high levels of stress and anxiety.</p>

                    <ul class="stress-benefits-list">
                        <li>According to the <strong>American Psychological Association</strong>, over 80% of teens report feeling stressed by schoolwork and responsibilities.</li>
                        <li>In college, surveys show that <strong>60% of students experience overwhelming anxiety</strong> at some point in the academic year.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Traditional strategies like meditation or therapy can help, but many students struggle to find quick and simple techniques they can use in the moment. That's where <strong>repetitive actions</strong> come in.</p>

                    <p>The human brain thrives on predictability and rhythm. <strong>Anxiety</strong>, by contrast, thrives on uncertainty and mental chaos. Repetitive actions create a sense of order that counteracts stress.</p>

                            <p><strong>Repetitive motions</strong> activate the brain's parasympathetic nervous system (the "rest and digest" system), which slows the heart rate and reduces cortisol. This is why slow, repetitive breathing can calm nerves before a big test.</p>

                    <p>Students already rely on these kinds of behaviors, often without realizing their psychological benefits:</p>

                    <ul class="examples-list">
                        <li><strong>Bubble Popping:</strong> Each pop is a mini dopamine reward, creating instant satisfaction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Doodling:</strong> Repeating shapes or patterns keeps hands busy and mind calmer, even during lectures.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fidgeting:</strong> Clicking a pen or spinning a fidget toy provides grounding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tapping/Drumming:</strong> Repetitive beats mirror the calming effects of rhythmic breathing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Knitting/Crocheting:</strong> Repeated stitches combine creativity with meditation-like flow.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These actions aren't distractions â€” they're <strong>tools for coping</strong>.</p>

                    <ul class="bubble-benefits">
                        <li><strong>Predictable rhythm:</strong> Every bubble is the same, creating a sense of order.</li>
